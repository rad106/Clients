# Clients
List of Fake Pharmaceutical Companies
#Project Mission
The reason I have chosen this sub directory order is 
because it mimics 
the chronological order of writing a bioanalytical report where I work. 
##Case Study
I think this would be a better system than our current way of keeping 
track of study folders. One of the problems I run into is that once a 
client goes inactive, it never gets swept into a historic or past client 
space. It’s like we are always hopefully that a client will come back 
one day.
###Future State
 I want to keep archives at the top of the list so that 
it is 
easy to find. I like having templates right below also for the quick 
access. I had an issue with the date format in the lecture, following 
ISO as 2023-01-13 etc. In pharma, I have always seen it done 13 Jan 
2023. I realize this doesn’t really work for non-English clients but 
that what FDA expects.
